# ATM Application - Software Development Application Project
This is an **ATM application** that combines a browser-based user interface with physical RFID card readers. It was developed by a five-member student team as part of a course project to practice **software development skills**, and the **integration of hardware and software components**.

### Application Features  
- Simulates ATM functions, including PIN code authentication, balance inquiry, deposits and withdrawals
- User authenticates with a physical RFID card
- Browser-based graphical user interface implemented with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

### Technologies Used
- C++
- JavaScript
- Arduino
- RFID card readers

## My Contribution  
I worked on the REST API together with another team member. The API was used to connect the browser-based user interface with the backend and to support the core features of the ATM simulation.

### Project Documentation
I was primarily responsible for the project documentation and project poster, working together with another team member.

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how software projects are built in practice and how web applications can be connected to physical hardware. I gained hands-on experience working with RFID readers and implementing REST APIs to pass data between the user interface and the backend.
